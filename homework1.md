<h3>ANSWER 1  -  ESSENTIAL DIFFICULTIES</h3>
<p align="justify">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAccording to Brooks, essential difficulties are difficulties that occur because of inherent or intrinsic nature of the software.
Brooks states that

>“The essence of a software entity is a construct of interlocking concepts: data sets, relationships among data items, algorithms, and invocations of functions. This essence is abstract in that such a conceptual construct is the same under many different representations. It is nonetheless highly precise and richly detailed.”

(Definition from No Silver bullet article).  According to brooks 80% of difficulties in software systems arise due to Essential 
difficulties. From the article “No Silver Bullet” we can understand that software systems are inherently complex and have lot of 
requirements and lot of constraints. So these inherent behaviours of the software systems produce many difficulties for making and
maintaining software. Let us consider an example of a Health Care System. The software team would have developed the software and would
have given the software to the client for testing. After seeing that, client may request lot of changes to the requirement. This is one 
of the main essential difficulties. As stated in lecture customers will not know when to request for changes. If the changes stated by
the customers are more, then it is difficult for the software team to redesign the software. Another example can be, software designed
for one state may not be used in other state because the rules and environment change. We should consider all this inherent difficulties in mind before developing software.</p>
